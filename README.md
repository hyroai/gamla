[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hyroai/gamla.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hyroai/gamla)

גamla is a performant functional programming library for python which supports `async`.

## Installation

`pip install gamla`

## Debugging anonymous compositions

`gamla.compose(x, y, z)` produces a new function which doesn't have a proper name. If `x` raises an exception, it is sometimes hard to figure out where this occurred. To overcome this, set the env variable `GAMLA_DEBUG_MODE` (to anything). This will cause the composition functions to give a name for the anonymous composition. The name would be a concatenation of its constituents' names, e.g. `x_of_y_of_z`. The name is given in a way that persists to the stack exceptions.

This is turned on only by flag because it incurs significant overhead so things might get slow.

## Mixing asynchronous and synchronous code

Most functions in this lib will work seamlessly with `async` and regular functions, and allow the developer to focus on the logic instead of deciding where to place an `await`.

For example:

```python
import asyncio

import gamla


def increment(i):
    return i + 1


async def increment_async(i):
    asyncio.sleep(1)
    return i + 1


async def run():
    mixed_composition = gamla.compose_left(increment, increment_async, increment)
    return await mixed_composition(0)  # returns 3!
```

## Migrating from `toolz`

The main problems - `toolz` is slow and does not support `async` functions.

### Why is it slow?

It uses the expensive `inspect` module to look at a function’s arguments, and doing so at each run. This happens not only on curried functions, but in compositions as well.

### Why does `gamla` not suffer from this problem?

Two reasons:

1. It does no longer support binary signatures on things like `map`, so it doesn’t need to infer anything (these are higher order functions in `gamla`).
1. The `gamla.curry` function pays for the signature inspection in advance, and remembers its results.

### Function mapping and common gotchas (written in blood):

- `curried.(filter|map|valmap|itemmap|keymap)` -> `gamla.$1` (make sure the call is with a single argument)
- `toolz.identity` -> `gamla.identity`
- `toolz.contains` -> `gamla.contains`
- `toolz.lt` -> `gamla.greater_than`
- `toolz.gt` -> `gamla.less_than`
- `toolz.ge` -> `gamla.less_equals`
- `toolz.le` -> `gamla.greater_equals`
- `toolz.filter(None) -> gamla.filter(gamla.identity)`
- `toolz.excepts(a, b, c)` -> `gamla.excepts(a, c, b)`
- `toolz.excepts(a, b)` -> `gamla.excepts(a, gamla.just(None), b)` (following the “data-last” currying convention)

## Releasing a new version

1. Create a pypi account.
1. Download twine and give it your pypi credentials.
1. Get pypi permissions for the project from its owner.
1. `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel; twine upload dist/*; rm -rf dist;`
